Hey, I'm Senophyx, an Indonesia-based coder with a passion for cool projects. Python is my go-to, but I'm also comfy with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and other programming language. You might've seen my [**Discord-RPC**](https://github.com/Senophyx/Discord-RPC) project, which got some attention from the Discord community. Also, I founded [**EterNomm**](https://github.com/EterNomm), a small organization focused on open-source projects.

I also have many experience as a sysadmin at various organizations and institutions, managing servers, databases, and users. I'm into gaming, music, design, photography, and all things geeky.

Lastly, You can find me with username **@Senophyx** on most social media platforms.
