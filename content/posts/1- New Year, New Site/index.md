# Opening

**Happy New Year 2025!**

2024 is really moving very fast and really unpredictable. Well, like other peoples when new year start, it's time to start something new and fresh. One of them is a new website. I wanted to completely revamp my old website to be more dynamic and completely different from before.

# The Reason
Actually, I have planned to change the appearance of my old website, but I haven’t found a big reason to change the front-end and also don’t have the best idea to change it.

It’s not that my current website looks bad, it just feels very boring and static. There’s not much that can be changed dynamically like other portfolio websites. But one day a Youtuber named [**NetworkChuck**](https://youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) posted a new video on how to create a blogging website in a complicated way, the programming-style in my opinion ([watch here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8) very recommended). I was curious and watched it, and sure enough, I really enjoyed it and was motivated to create my own blogging website.

That’s where the idea to change the look of my old website came up, I finally had the right reason to replace my old website. I also became more challenged because now it is at the end of 2024, this is the right time to start something new.

# Why Blog?

The reason I was so interested and motivated to create a blog was because my initial goal was to make my website more dynamic with my posts. I also have a place to share my thoughts, ideas, and a place to put changelogs of some of my projects instead of having to put them on Github Gist. And also what makes it unique is the process of posting the blog, instead of just you logging in, writing and posting. it’s the classic boring way.

This is where I use [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io) as a framework to generate websites using Markdown. I know Hugo is used to create static websites, but what makes it dynamic is by adding content to the website to keep it fresh. And I also have the option to create or use themes according to my own preferences. I’m currently using the [**typo**](https://github.com/tomfran/typo) theme from [**Francesco Tomaselli or Tomfran**](https://github.com/tomfran) with a few modifications, and I really love how simple this theme is.

# Conclusions

Maybe creating a blog website is not a bad thing, right? I know it’s not something that is ideal for a portfolio website, but the good thing is maybe this is the right place for me to express my ideas and projects that might be useful in the future. I can’t decide how often I post, but I will try to post as often as possible. Shower thoughts might be a fun one lol.

By the way, if you’re asking, will I change my website every year? Maybe, but it’s not something that will be my priority at the end of the year. So just wait for the end of 2025 ;)
